# Takedown & Dispute Process (Draft)
If you believe a listing is inaccurate or infringes your rights:
1. Open an issue using “Claim or Update Listing” and provide proof.
2. Or contact your Hyland representative with the listing slug and evidence.
3. We will investigate and may temporarily hide the listing during review.
