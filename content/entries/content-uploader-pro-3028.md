title: "Content Uploader Pro"
description: "Currently in Alfresco Share, the document could only be categorized by invoking the â€œEdit Metadataâ€ screen once the document gets uploaded successfully. This introduces few extra clicks and steps to categorize the document. Organizations however require the capability to categorize the document during the document upload itself to avoid uncategorized documents being added to the Alfresco respository. Content Uploader Pro for Alfresco Share provides the functionality to categorize digital content such as documents at the time of upload to Alfresco repository. It provides a custom document upload form with the capability to categorize the document based on attributes such as document type, department, functions, impact etc."
