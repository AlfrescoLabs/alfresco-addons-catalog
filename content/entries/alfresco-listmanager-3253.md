title: Alfresco Listmanager
description: 'This addon provides a way to manage list of values to be used in alfresco
  metadata forms. The model provided constraints are not always suitable to use. Sometimes
  you just want to pick a value from a list without constraining anything. In addition
  there is no need to restart Alfresco after editing the lists (which is the case
  when using contraints). Owner Erik Billerby ‌ Versions Community 4.0.x Community

  list of values used in metadata forms.'
