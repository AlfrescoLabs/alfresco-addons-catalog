title: "Share OAuth"
description: "This add-on provides a custom Spring Surf connector and client-side helper class, allowing easy OAuth-based access to external resources. It is a prerequisite for the Twitter, Yammer and LinkedIn dashlets provided by Share Extras. It could also be used by others who need to develop Share add-ons that require coordinating third-party authentication with OAuth.
