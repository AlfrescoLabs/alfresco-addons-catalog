title: "Alfresco Reset Password / Forgot Password"
description: "This Add-on adds self-service Forgot Password / Password Reset Functionality to Alfresco, instead of contacting Alfresco Admin for resetting the password. The module includes a simple Login page with Forgot Password button and two additional pages for accepting the username and for entering the new password. The Password Reset link is sent to the email associated with user's account, valid for only one-time use in 24 hours."
