description: "The Alfresco Dropbox Connector Allows you to synchronize files between Alfresco and Dropbox. This Add-On will not yet work with Alfresco Community 4.0.d/4.0.e because it has some dependencies that are not yet in an official Community release. It will hopefully work with the next release of Community Edition.
