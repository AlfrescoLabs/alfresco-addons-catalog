title: "VERS SARKMS"
description: "VERS stands for Victorian Electronic Records Strategy, and it is an important standard in Victoria, Australia. It was developed by the Public Record Office Victoria to help Victorian government agencies manage, store and access their electronic records. One of the benefits is that it ensures that Victorias key electronic information can identified, preserved and accessible in the future, regardless of how it was created. It does this through the definition of specific supported file types and associated metadata. The VERS add-on module for Alfresco was created so that Alfresco could be VERS compliant and be counted among the select few products that can be used by Victorian government agencies. SARKMS is South Australias Record Keeping Metadata."
