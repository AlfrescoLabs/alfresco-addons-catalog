title: "Periodic Document Review"
description: "The set of default tasks provided out-of-the-box by Alfresco are quite simplistic. They consist of an ad-hoc task and a small number of review and approve tasks, for both single and group approvers. That may well be sufficient for most purposes, however, you may need to have more complex review tasks with a set of reviewers or a set of approvers, defined by you. Typically, those documents need to be reviewed at specific intervals, such as every year. But wouldn't it be great to have a combination of a Periodic Workflow which can trigger an action to a set of reviewers at the right time. Welcome to the Periodic Document Review Module."
