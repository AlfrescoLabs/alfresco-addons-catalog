title: "Contentreich Alfresco Email"
description: "The email-address is frequently used to identify users. In general, the users know it better than a username such as \\\"asteffan123\\\". Using the email-address for identification reduces the chance to enter wrong credentials during the login process. Besides, it supports better realization of the use case \\\"Forgot password\\\". An out-of-the-box installation does not really honour the the email as a primary user identifier for various reasons. In enterprise environments, it is common to have other external authentication systems in place (e.g. Active Directory) where an application like Alfresco is not granted permissions to change data. In such a scenario, realizing the \\\"forgot password\\\" use case may prove to be difficult."
