title: "User Management - Password Reset & Limit Users"
description: "EisenVault (www.eisenvault.com) has released this add-on that allows users to reset passwords without contacting Administrator. Features : 1. Limiting the number of users - you can limit the number of users. 2. Forgot password - User can now reset their password from the login page. They need to enter their username after which a mail will be shot to the user's registered email id which contains the link to reset the password. This feature will only work when two things are there in the system. A template that is required for the email. This template will be copied automatically when a new tenant is created through self-server tenant account but for tenants created manually these needs to be copied manually."
