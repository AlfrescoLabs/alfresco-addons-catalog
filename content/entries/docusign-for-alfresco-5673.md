description: "The Docusign for Alfresco Addon allows users to manage e-signature requests from Alfresco. It integrates with Docusign to manage the signature proceess. A user can request a signature from multiple signees and then keep track of the signature request lifecycle using a Signatures Dashboard. Meanwhile the original and signed documents are stored in the Alfresco Repository to allow for your record keeping requirements. The solution includes changes to Share and Digital Workspce for user interaction and a Rest interface for integration scenarios."
