about: "- Generates `cm:markdown` (`text/markdown`) from the PDF version of a document using either the newly created `cm:pdf` rendition or the original when itâ€™s already PDF. So Markdown is produced for any source mimetype\n- Works in two cases:\n  1) When Alfresco generates a `cm:pdf` rendition from another format (DOCX, ODT, etc.)\n  2) When the original upload is already a PDF\n- The Markdown file is stored as a proper rendition:\n  - Association: `rn:rendition`\n  - Association name (rendition id): `cm:m"
