title: "LibreOffice Online Edit Module"
description: "The module is an addon to Alfresco which makes it possible to edit documents online in LibreOffice over CMIS from the browser. This allows for a seamless integration of the open source document suite LibreOffice with Alfresco, making it easy to adopt an open source alternative for document management in your organization. The integration module works with LibreOffice 4.x and later on Windows, MacOSX and Linux with using standard web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer. The integration module uses Java Applet technology and will require that the web browser is allowed to run signed Java Applets. For more information on the module please visit the project home page or the Redpill Linpro AB web site."
