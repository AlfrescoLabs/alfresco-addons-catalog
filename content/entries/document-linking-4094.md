title: "Document Linking"
description: "Parashifts Document Linking add-on for Alfresco allows users to access documents from multiple locations, without having to copy or duplicate them to other sites or folders. The module also solves other challenges by ensuring any changes made to the parent document are automatically replicated to all versions regardless of their location in Alfresco. All users will now have confidence that they are always working with the most up-to-date version, such as pricing lists and company policies and procedures. The Document Linking module is open source and offered just like Alfresco Enterprise: on a subscription basis, giving users access to support and maintenance utilizing Parashifts GitLab server for sources, updates and issue tracking facilities."
