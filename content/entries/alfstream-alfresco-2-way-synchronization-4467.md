title: "AlfStream - Alfresco 2-way Synchronization"
description: "AlfStream, is an Alfresco Add-On that enables users to scale their operations from one Alfresco instance to many, through synchronization. Alfstream is an effort to turn the Alfresco database into a more transactional event-driven system.â€‚â€‚This can be seen as a form of stream processing , or an application of the Event Sourcing design pattern. What Alfstream is at its core is a way to subscribe to a stream of events that occur in Alfresco: creates, reads, updates and deletes, which can be synchronised with another system.â€‚â€‚ Every time an change is taken within Alfresco, an event is triggered, so that anything observing these events can act upon them accordingly."
