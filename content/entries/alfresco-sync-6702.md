title: "Alfresco Sync"
description: "The Alfesco Sync addon syncs a source folder with a target folder within your Repository. Any changes within the source folder hierarchy will be synced to the target folder. An example use case is publishing documents managed by content authors from one Site to a target audience in a different site that do not have access to the source site or content. Note: This is designed to allow one way sync of content between folders and Sites to enable collaboration and sharing of content. It is not designed as a method of providing backup or as a migration tool. Owner Seed Information Management Pty. Ltd."
