title: "Alfresco Remove Versions from Share"
description: "**Background** This project has been developed as sample for **How to extend (properly) and \\\"old\\\" Alfresco Share feature** talk at [Alfresco DevCon 2018]( https://devcon.alfresco.com ). If you want to learn how to develop this addon, attend **Alfresco DevCon** or watch the recorded session. **Description** Alfresco Share only exposes actions to *revert*, *download* and *view properties* for every action of a node. This addon includes a *delete* action which removes the version from the repository. The action is available at document detail version list and it's only visible for members of group `VERSION_REMOVERS`. **License** The plugin is licensed under the [LGPL v3.0]( http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html )."
