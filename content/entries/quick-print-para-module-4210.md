title: "Quick Print - Para Module"
description: "One of the biggest roadblocks with Alfresco's built-in viewer is its inability to view and print documents without having to download them. The current process requires users to download the intended document, open it in the relevant application and then print it. This can be a cumbersome task for users who handle hundreds of documents a day, especially if they are large files. For users, this results in decreases in productivity and efficiency. Welcome to the Quick Print module. Parashift's Quick Print add-on for Alfresco lets users perform this action quickly by allowing printing directly from the browser, all without having to download it."
