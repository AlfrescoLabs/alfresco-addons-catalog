title: "New Trashcan Cleaner"
description: "This library adds a scheduled job that will empty your Alfresco trashcan according to configuration. It differs from the other Trashcan Cleaner add-on ( https://github.com/rjmfernandes/alfresco-trashcan-cleaner , old location: http://addons.alfresco.com/addons/trashcan-cleaner ) because: It does not rely on the search service. This allows it to work even if the Solr repository has been optimized to not index the archive store. The scheduled job is cluster aware. As of Alfresco Platform 5.2, the Trashcan Cleaner is included in the core of the Alfresco ECM repository."
