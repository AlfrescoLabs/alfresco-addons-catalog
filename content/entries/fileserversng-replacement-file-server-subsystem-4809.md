title: "fileServersNG - Replacement file server subsystem"
description: "The fileServersNG module replaces the file servers subsystem that ships as part of the standard Alfresco Content Management System with a new subsystem that is based on the JFileServer file server code, enabling support for the newer SMB2 and SMB3 protocols via the Enterprise add-on (that works with Alfresco Community and Enterprise editions). There is a Docker image available that has an Alfresco 5.2 installation with the fileServersNG file servers subsystem deployed. For details of how to get the Docker image and configure it see the FileSys.Org Wiki . Details of how to build the fileServersNG file servers subsystem AMP for Alfresco v4.x and v5.x installations is also available on the FileSys.Org Wiki."
