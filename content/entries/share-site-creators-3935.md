title: "Share Site Creators"
description: "This add-on gives you the ability to restrict Alfresco Share site creation to a specific group of users. Users not in the group will not see a \\\"Create Site\\\" link in: The header Sites dropdown menu The My Sites dashlet The \\\"welcome\\\" dashlet In addition, for users not in the group, the \\\"welcome\\\" dashlet's text changes to explain what a Share site is but does not imply that they have the ability to create one. A nice enhancement might be a link that launches a workflow to request a new site. (Pull requests welcome!) By default, the group the module looks for must have an ID of \\\"GROUP_SITE_CREATORS\\\". The display name can be anything."
