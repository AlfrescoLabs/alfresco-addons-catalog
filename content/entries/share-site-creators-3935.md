title: Share Site Creators
description: 'This add-on gives you the ability to restrict Alfresco Share site creation
  to a specific group of users. Users not in the group will not see a \"Create Site\"
  link in: The header Sites dropdown menu The My Sites dashlet The \"welcome\" dashlet
  In addition, for users not in the group, the \"welcome\" dashlet''s text changes
  to explain what a Share site is but does not imply that they have the ability to
  create one. A nice enhancement might be a link that launches a workflow to request
  a new site. (Pull requests welcome!) By default, the group the module looks for
  must have an ID of \"GROUP_SITE_CREATORS\". The display name can be anything.'
