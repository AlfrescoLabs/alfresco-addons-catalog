description: "Zia Consulting ZSign is an add-on for Alfresco, allowing users to electronically sign documents within their repository. It's the ideal solution for executive, finance, legal, sales, and HR personnel to execute contracts, purchase orders, expense reports, work orders, timesheets, addendums, and much more. Whether you are in the private or public sector, ZSign allows organizations to recognize the full benefits of going paperless by eliminating the need to print out, route, wet-sign and rescan documents. Additionally, ZSign can be used with Alfresco's workflow to allow document signing to be integrated within the approval processes to streamline execution of these documents."
