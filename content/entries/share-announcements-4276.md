title: "Share Announcements"
description: "This add-on let's you manage system announcements as plain text files in the Data Dictionary, then it displays those announcements on the Alfresco Share login page. Old announcements can be kept in an archive folder--those will be ignored by the announcements RESTful endpoint. The add-on also includes an \\\"Announcements\\\" dashlet that displays the same set of announcements shown on the login page to unauthenticated users in a dashlet on authenticated user dashboards."
