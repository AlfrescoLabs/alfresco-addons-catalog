title: "Enhanced Script Environment"
description: "The Enhanced Script Environment is an addon to Repository and Share that addresses some long-standing issues with JavaScript execution in Alfresco. It adds a clean, extensible API for script imports (inspired by https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ALF-13631 ), improvements to logging, support for parallel batch processing and remote debugging using Eclipse JSDT tooling. Optional \\\"patch\\\" addons provide a granularized version of the document list data web script that allows developers to simply add new filters by dropping in a small JavaScript files in /tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/registeredScripts/documentlibrary-v2-filters/general/ and overriding the Share filters.get.config.xml file. No need to override the entire doclist.get.js / doclist.lib.js file anymore."
