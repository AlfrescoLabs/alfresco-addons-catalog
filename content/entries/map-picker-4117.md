title: "Map Picker"
description: "Parashiftâ€™s Map Picker add-on for Alfresco lets users define an area on a map to further discover which documents or images are based in that area. Map Picker lets Solr do all the hard work searching for geolocated documents. Users now have an additional method of searching, increasing productivity and efficiency. The Map Picker module is open source and offered just like Alfresco Enterprise: on a subscription basis, giving users access to support and maintenance utilising Parashiftâ€™s GitLab server for sources, updates and issue tracking facilities. If the subscription is cancelled, the Map Picker module will continue to function; however, continued upgrades and maintenance will not be provided. Features: Geolocation."
