title: "Compare the Differences between MS-Word Files"
description: "We often need to compare the differences between two Microsoft Word files, or the differences between one file but with different versions. Base on this addon, you can compare Word files automatically. All you need to do is move the files you want to compare in a same folder, it will automatically generate a new differential file. When you open the differential file, youâ€™ll see all differences points within in the files."
