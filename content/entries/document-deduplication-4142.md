title: "Document Deduplication"
description: "Once installed Parashift's Document Deduplication add-on for Alfresco will add a similar documents panel into your Alfresco system. Here similar content is easily identified, whether they be near or exact matches, the system will show all results. The Document Deduplication module is open source and offered just like Alfresco Enterprise: on a subscription basis, giving users access to support and maintenance utilizing Parashift's GitLab server for sources, updates and issue tracking facilities. If the subscription is cancelled, the Document Deduplication module will continue to function; however, continued upgrades and maintenance will not be provided."
