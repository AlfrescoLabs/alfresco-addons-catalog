title: "Geo-Views"
description: "This project provides the following components which display geotagged content items within map views and to modify the geographic information associated with stored items. By default Google Maps is used to render map views, with support for Leaflet included via additional Share modules (requires Alfresco 4.0 or greater). The add-on has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco 3.4 or 4.x installation. It can work with version 3.3 if the cm:geographic aspect is added to the repository's content model - see Known Issues. -Site Geotagged Content Dashlet This dashlet displays site content on a configurable map view on the site dashboard in Alfresco 3.3 or greater."
